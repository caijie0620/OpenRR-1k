# OpenRR-1k: A scalable dataset for real-world reflection removal


## Dataset
The dataset is available on Hugging Face ðŸ¤—:
[OpenRR-1k Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/qiuzhangTiTi/NTIRE2025-SIRR)

The dataset contains:
- `train_800.zip`: Contains both Input images and Ground Truth (GT)
- `val_100.zip`: Contains both Input images and Ground Truth (GT)
- `test_100.zip`: Contains both Input images and Ground Truth (GT)

## ðŸ“¢ **Repository Renamed**

This repository was previously named **`Reflection-Removal-in-the-Wild`**, and has been renamed to **`OpenRR-1k`** to better reflect its scope as an open benchmark for real-world reflection removal.

All previous links to the old repository name will continue to work via GitHub redirection.
